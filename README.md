# Problem Statement
An animal shelter management system for animal shelters. Create an animal shelter management  software to help enable them to manage business operations efficiently and effectively while reducing friction in the pet adoption process. Animals that are lost or abandoned are kept in animal shelters while finding potential adopters to input data about themselves and be matched to a pet that fits their lifestyle. It should be accessible to users and administrators. Generous people who want to donate in the organization through online mode should have an option to do it fluently. The software should have an option where pet owners can drop their pets for a few days while they are away. Apart from that a person can donate their pets to the organization as well if required conditions are met.
